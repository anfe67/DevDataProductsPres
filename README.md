# DevDataProductsPres

## Reproducible Pitch Presentation

Here you find my 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) concerning my app. After an initial attempt with RStudio 
I settled for Slidify because I feel it gives me more control.

The presentation can be found at http://anfe67.github.io/DevDataProductsPres/, in the gh-pages branch of this repository. 

It includes 2 slides with code, one that shows the clean up of the dataset and the other that makes a plot similar to the 
Shiny app that I wrote.
